/**
 * This class represents pizzas. A pizza has a name and a price as well as a
 * list of toppings. Each topping is represented by a string, which you can
 * assume is always in lower case.
 *
 * Your task is to implement the MarkdownExport interface in this class. The
 * exportMarkdown() method should return a markdown representation of the pizza
 * object. The markdown representation should look something like this:
 *
 *
 * # Hawaiian
 *
 * Toppings:
 * - ham
 * - pineapple
 * - mozarella
 *
 * Price: 10.90
