/**
 * Improve this class by implementing the Comparable interface. The class should
 * be comparable based on the population of the country.
 *
 * The Comparable interface defines only one method: compareTo. The method
 * should compare the population of the "current" country (this) to the
 * population of the "other" country (the argument of the method). The method
 * should return a negative number if the population of this country is smaller
 * than, a positive number if it is larger than, and 0 if it is equal to the
 * population of the other country.
