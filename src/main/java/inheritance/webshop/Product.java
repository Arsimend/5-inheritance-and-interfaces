/**
 * This class represents products in a webshop application. The class will be
 * used as a base class for various product types in the next parts of the
 * exercise.
 *
 * You will need to add the following private instance variables to the class:
 * title (string), description (string) and price (double). The class already
 * has a constructor that takes the values as arguments, but you need to
 * complete its implementation.
 *
 * Also, create getter methods getTitle(), getDescription() and getPrice() to
 * return the values of the instance variables.
 *
 * Finally, create a toString() method that returns a string representation of
 * the product. You can decide yourself how the string should look like, but it
 * must contain the title, description and price of the product.
 *
 * Note that this class itself does not utilize inheritance, but it will
 * extended by other classes in the exercise.
