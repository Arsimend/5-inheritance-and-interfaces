/**
 * This class represents vehicles in a webshop application. Vehicles are
 * products, but they have some additional properties that other products do not
 * have, such as the manufacturer, the model and the year.
 *
 * In this exercise, you need to make the Vehicle class inherit the Product
 * class. Here, you will need to use the `extends` keyword. You also need to add
 * the following private instance variables to the class: manufacturer (string),
 * model (string) and year (int) and getters for each of them.
 *
 * The constructor of the Vehicle class is already present, but you will need to
 * complete its implementation.
 *
 * Also, create a toString() method that returns a string representation of the
 * vehicle. You can decide yourself how the string should look like, but it must
 * contain both the product properties and the vehicle properties.
